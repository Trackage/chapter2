  year = {2000},
  abstract = {Many researchers wish to explore and analyse spatial data, but typical
	software does not readily permit such integration. This note presents
	a simple interface between two open source software systems, the
	GRASS geographical information system, and the R statistical data
	analysis language. The platform used here is GNU/Linux, because both
	systems compile and install cleanly; R runs cleanly in Windows environments
	as well. The interface allows floating point and category data to
	be passed both ways for raster map layers and sites files; NULL GRASS
	raster cells interchange with R NA (not available) values. Because
	both systems are developing rapidly and GRASS database internals
	changing often, the interface uses ASCII transfer via temporary files
	generated by standard programs. The interface operates by running
	R from within the GRASS environment, and issues commands to GRASS
	programs through the R system() function. The accompanying code is
	constructed as an R package, and contains wrapper functions for R
	plotting, and for R analytical functions returning gridded output,
	such as trend surface and kriging prediction, kernel density estimation
	of point patterns, and bicubic spline interpolation. These typical
	spatial analytical techniques, also often available in some form
	in GIS, are amply buttressed in R by a large range of other statistical
	and graphical functions, giving substantial insight into the data
	or results being handled. The interface will be extended to vector
	data, and will be coordinated with other database integration packages
	in R and GRASS. Key words: Geographical information systems, Open
	source software, Interface package.},

	an empirical calibration constant for latitude and another for longitude
	based on a trial against realistic noise in irradiance field data,
	which typically display strong point-to-point correlations. Such
	a calibration is reported here, making the error estimate available
	for use. The calibration is based on a 458-day set of blue-light
	irradiance data taken by an archival tag (Lotek LTD750) at a known
	location on land (48.57°N, 122.94°W). For the data studied, median
	values of the estimated daily standard deviations were 0.42° in longitude,
	0.95° in latitude. The error estimates include the effects of weather
	and other data noise, latitude, and season, so (1) they vary widely
	from day to day and with season, and (2) they can be cautiously expected
	to remain valid in situations other than the particular one tested.
	A change in the character of the data noise is the only factor expected
	to have a significant effect on the calibration; this work should
	be repeated to sample the expected range of data noise types.},

	the hypothetico-deductive epistemology of Popper and the frequentist
	statistical methodology of Fisher. Consequently, our null hypotheses
	do not often take into account pre-existing data and do not require
	parameterization, our experiments demand large sample sizes, and
	we rarely use results from one experiment to predict the outcomes
	of future experiments. Comparative statistical statements such as
	"we reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 level," which reflect
	the likelihood of our data given our hypothesis, are of little use
	in communicating our results to nonspecialists or in describing the
	degree of certitude we have in our conclusions. In contrast, Bayesian
	statistical inference requires the explicit assignment of prior probabilities,
	based on existing information, to the outcomes of experiments. Such
	an assignment forces the parameterization of null and alternative
	hypotheses. The results of these experiments, regardless of sample
	size, then can be used to compute posterior probabilities of our
	hypotheses given the available data. Inferential conclusions in a
	Bayesian mode also are more meaningful in environmental policy discussions:
	e.g., "our experiments indicate that there is a 95% probability that
	acid deposition will affect northeastern conifer forests." Based
	on comparisons with current statistical practice in ecology, I argue
	that a "Bayesian ecology" would (a) make better use of pre-existing
	data; (b) allow stronger conclusions to be drawn from large-scale
	experiments with few replicates; and (c) be more relevant to environmental
	decision-making.},

  pages = {251-261},
  abstract = {The foraging behaviour of animals depends on the distribution, abundance
	and predictability of their food resources. In the marine environment,
	top predators such as seabirds are known to concentrate their foraging
	effort in specific oceanic features where productivity is elevated
	or prey concentrated. When marine productivity is low and prey distribution
	unpredictable, such as in tropical waters, selection should favour
	the evolution of flexible foraging strategies. By using GPS, Argos
	transmitters and activity recorders, we studied the foraging strategy
	of red-footed boobies (RFBs) Sula sula breeding on Europa Island
	in the Mozambique Channel, to examine the way a central place forager
	searches for prey in tropical waters. RFBs only foraged during the
	day-time and never sat on the water at night; thus, they consequently
	had a limited maximum foraging range of 148 km. Primary production
	within this range was low overall (average 0.165 mg chlorophyll m–3),
	with a high spatial and temporal heterogeneity due to the presence
	of strong geostrophic currents and surface mixing by storms. RFBs
	appear to adjust their foraging strategy to cope with this situation.
	Individual birds do not return to the same oceanic sites from one
	trip to the next, but generally head in the direction of zones where
	productivity is enhanced. Active foraging, i.e. periods when birds
	spent time on the sea surface or dived, occurred at the most distant
	part of the foraging trip. Despite their limited foraging range and
	the low productivity of surrounding waters, red-footed boobies are
	able to track zones of prey availability located in areas of enhanced
	primary production. Searching is probably favoured by the presence
	of sub-surface predators that chase prey to the surface. The foraging
	strategy of this tropical sulid appears to differ extensively from},

	and relative directions between consecutive satellite telemetry locations,
	I developed an alternative error index, xi , and compared its performance
	with that of the location quality index, NQ (Serv. Argos 1988). In
	controlled tests, xi was more (P less than or equal to 0.005) effective
	for improving precision than was a threshold of NQ > 1. The xi index
	also conferred greater control over the trade off between sample
	size and precision, making xi more cost-effective than NQ. Performances
	of xi and NQ were otherwise comparable. In field tests with bighorn
	sheep (Ovis canadensis), rejecting locations where xi greater than
	or equal to 1.5 km reduced (P < 0.001) longitudinal dispersion, the
	predominant error component. Longitudinal dispersion for these locations
	was less (P = 0.025) than for locations where NQ > 1 and 63% fewer
	data were censored, so that the extent of animals' movements was
	better indicated by using xi rather than NQ. Because use of xi may
	lead to underestimating the number of long-range, short-term forays
	(especially when the frequency of forays is high relative to sampling
	frequency), potential bias should be considered before using xi .
	Nonetheless, xi should be a useful alternative to NQ in many animal-tracking
	studies.},

  abstract = {In this paper we introduce a new underlying probabilistic model for
	principal
	
	component analysis (PCA). Our formulation interprets PCA as a
	
	particular Gaussian process prior on a mapping from a latent space
	to
	
	the observed data-space. We show that if the prior’s covariance function
	
	constrains the mappings to be linear the model is equivalent to PCA,
	
	we then extend the model by considering less restrictive covariance
	functions
	
	which allow non-linear mappings. This more general Gaussian process
	
	latent variable model (GPLVM) is then evaluated as an approach to
	
	the visualisation of high dimensional data for three different data-sets.
	
	Additionally our non-linear algorithm can be further kernelised leading
	
	to ‘twin kernel PCA’ in which a mapping between feature spaces occurs.},

  abstract = {Data describing the thickness of the Antarctic ice sheet collected
	on surveys undertaken
	
	over the past 50 years have been brought together into a single database.
	These data have
	
	allowed the compilation of a suite of seamless digital topographic
	models for the Antarctic
	
	continent and surrounding ocean. The suite includes grids representing;
	ice-sheet thickness
	
	over the ice sheet and shelves, water-column thickness beneath the
	floating ice shelves, bed
	
	elevation beneath the grounded ice sheet, and bathymetry to 60°S including
	the areas
	
	beneath the ice shelves. These grids are consistent with a recent
	high-resolution surface
	
	elevation model of Antarctica. While the digital models have a nominal
	spatial resolution of 5
	
	km, such high resolution is not strictly justified by the original
	data density over all parts of
	
	the ice sheet. The suite does however provide an unparalleled vision
	of the geosphere
	
	beneath the ice sheet and a more reliable basis for ice sheet modelling.
	The total volume of
	
	the Antarctic ice sheet is calculated to be 25.4 million km3 while
	the total sea level
	
	equivalent, derived from the amount of ice contained within the grounded
	ice sheet is 57 m,
	
	comprising 52 m from the East Antarctic ice sheet and 5 m from the
	West Antarctic ice
	
	sheet. The gridded data sets can be obtained from the authors.},

  abstract = {Johnson et al. (Journal of Animal Ecology, 2002,71, 225–235) have
	proposed a new
	
	technique for identifying scales of movement in animals. Animals are
	located at certain
	
	time intervals, and movement rates between successive animal relocations
	are calculated.
	
	The null model of a nonscalar response predicts a decreasing linear
	relationship
	
	between log(frequency) vs. movement rate, while a scalar response
	predicts a monotonically
	
	decreasing curve with an inflection point at the separation between
	the processes.
	
	I tested this technique using three types of simulated movement paths:
	correlated
	
	random walks, directed walks, and movements in patchy habitat. None
	of the simulations
	
	showed the results expected by the technique. This occurs because
	the technique
	
	assumes that movement rates are exponentially distributed, which is
	highly unlikely.
	
	Thus before this technique can be applied to animal movement data
	we need to understand
	
	how spatial and temporal scale, as well as sampling interval, affect
	the frequency
	
	histogram of animal movement rates.},

@PHDTHESIS{,
  author = {François ROYER},
  __markedentry = {[mdsumner]},
  abstract = {1] The spatial and temporal dynamics of Atlantic bluefin tuna, Thunnus
	thynnus, are here investigated through data analysis and statistical
	modelling. The local, regional and global scales are considered successively.
	A phenomenological approach is favoured, as well the extended use
	of image processing tools and estimation theory techniques. Their
	potential role in partially observed or ill-defined problems in marine
	ecology is presented and discussed. The acute need for frequency-explicit
	methods is in particular stressed out. Hypothesis testing and significance
	testing of ecological space/time processes are further discussed.
	
	
	[2] The first chapter depicts how surface fronts can structure the
	pelagic habitat: dedicated detection and mapping tools are introduced,
	along with an example in the North-East Atlantic and the Mediterranean
	regions. The influence of such heterogeneity on top predators is
	then discussed and illustrated with a case study in the gulf of Lions:
	high resolution datasets derived from aerial surveys and satellite
	radiometry are merged for this purpose. Monte-Carlo methods are shown
	to be of great value to assess the significance of observed spatial
	patterns.
	
	
	[3] The second chapter introduces an individual-based view of the
	pelagic habitat, through the use of archival tags. Three major drawbacks
	of this approach are first listed, i.e. (i) the large geolocation
	errors linked to hardware and software issues, (ii) the non-linearity
	and ill-posedness of the initial estimation problem, and (iii) the
	lack of accurate and continuous 3D ancillary data sources. A Monte-Carlo
	method is proposed to address these problems, and applied first to
	a controlled case. A real world application is then presented, involving
	pop-up tags and 3D temperature outputs from the Mercator model in
	the Gulf Stream area. Some specific technical points and issues to
	resolve are pinpointed.
	
	
	[4] In the third part of this work, an extended time series analysis
	is conducted on the long-term fluctuations in the bluefin tuna population,
	as derived from coastal trap catches in the Mediterranean sea. Linear
	and non-linear general techniques are employed to uncover deterministic
	features in these series. A direct and delayed density-dependence
	is in particular extracted from the high frequency component of the
	data. Possible endogenous and exogenous causes for the low and high
	frequency are discussed, as well as the need for new significance
	tests in studies involving long term changes.},

  abstract = {Archival tagging provides a unique way to study the spatial dynamics
	and habitat of
	
	pelagic fish. This technique generates lagrangian data of a particular
	type in marine
	
	ecology: although highly informative about processes at different
	scales (e.g. horizontal
	
	movements versus diving behaviour), such data are impaired by location
	errors and the
	
	lack of combination with actual environmental variability. The present
	paper
	
	introduces a framework for modelling bluefin tuna movement in relation
	to its
	
	habitat, using records of light, depth and temperature from archival
	tags. Based on data
	
	assimilation concepts and methods, we show how an explicit formulation
	of the
	
	observation process and the statistics of external variables (e.g.
	ambient temperature)
	
	can improve precision in geolocation. The proposed method is tested
	on synthetic data:
	
	significant reduction (40 to 50%) in the initial root-mean square
	error is achieved under
	
	different noise scenarios. Assimilating sea surface temperature also
	allows to perform
	
	on-line estimation of a range of observation biases. The performance
	of the model
	
	greatly benefits from the adequate formalisation of different variability
	sources, and
	
	allows potentially to reveal interactions between the fish and its
	habitat. Using this
	
	probabilistic approach, we, however, show that some patterns of interest
	(e.g. foraging
	
	in surface fronts) can hardly be retrieved in a context of large observational
	and
	
	environmental noise.},

  abstract = {Advances in animal tag technologies now offer a
	
	significant method for gathering oceanographic information
	
	throughout the world's oceans. By employing marine organisms
	
	as oceanic samplers (MOOS), vast amounts of in situ data (e.g.
	
	temperature, productivity and salinity in relation to depth and
	
	location) can be archived and transmitted via satellite or
	
	obtained directly from the tag if the tag is recovered. The beauty
	
	of this technique is that no on-board navigation system nor
	
	external propulsion supply is required. The animal performs the
	
	work necessary to transport the equipment and chooses what
	
	transect to run. The gathered data, guided by the animal's point
	
	of view, reveal secrets of the animal's life and pinpoint
	
	environmental features most important to its lifestyle.
	
	Depending on the species tagged, the animal may perform a
	
	number of tasks of great interest to oceanographers e.g.
	
	gathering data from remote regions like the poles, performing
	
	repeated deep dives, targeting specific food sources or
	
	oceanographic features and traversing massive expanses of
	
	ocean. The breadth of animal species with which this technology
	
	has been successfully deployed is growing steadily. The list
	
	includes bluefin and yellowfin tuna, white sharks, thresher
	
	sharks, whale sharks, ocean sunfish, marine turtles, seals, sea
	
	lions, and seabirds. It is hoped that the wealth of tag data
	
	already being collected worldwide can serve both the needs of
	
	the biologic and oceanographic communities alike.},

	Johnson
	
	et al
	
	. (
	
	Journal of Animal Ecology
	
	, 2002,
	
	71
	
	, 225–235) proposed a technique
	
	for stratifying the movements of ungulates into small- and large-scale
	behaviours. They
	
	identified movement paths for woodland caribou and fitted a nonlinear
	curve to the logfrequency
	
	of movement rates. They assumed that slow small-scale movements were
	correlated
	
	with foraging activities in patches and faster large-scale movements
	occurred
	
	when caribou moved between patches.
	
	2.
	
	Nams (
	
	Journal of Animal Ecology
	
	, 2006,
	
	75
	
	, 298–302) reviewed the assumptions and
	
	tested the technique presented by Johnson
	
	et al
	
	. (2002). Simulated animal movements
	
	resulted in rates inconsistent with the data of Johnson
	
	et al
	
	. (2002) and the distribution
	
	necessary to fit the nonlinear curve. Nams (2006) challenged animal
	movement as suitable
	
	for the technique and concluded that sampling interval would confound
	results.
	
	3.
	
	We evaluated Nams’s (2006) criticisms with movement data collected
	for caribou,
	
	moose and mountain goat. All three species demonstrated the required
	distribution of
	
	movement rates and sampling interval had little influence on the criterion
	used to
	
	identify scales of movement for a range of woodland caribou data.
	In addition, we
	
	tested the sensitivity of the curve-fitting model to the width of
	the frequency interval for
	
	the log-frequency plot of movement rates. We noted bias in the rate
	criterion, but the
	
	scalar relationship was consistent among interval widths.
	
	4.
	
	The discrepancy in movement data presented by Nams (2006) and Johnson
	
	et al
	
	.
	
	(2002) is likely the result of different movement processes. The movements
	of simulated
	
	animals did not encompass the full range of behaviours typically observed
	for ungulates.
	
	Our analyses and those of Nams (2006) provide little evidence to universally
	reject the
	
	nonlinear curve-fitting model and the results of Johnson
	
	et al
	
	. (2002). However, we
	
	caution against blind application of the technique, as not all movement
	processes are
	
	suitable and the scale of movement must be consistent with the scale
	of the behaviour.
	
	Key-words
