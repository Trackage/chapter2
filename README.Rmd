# chapter2

The goal of chapter2 is to resurrect and modernize the material of my thesis [chapter 2, The Tag Location Problem](https://eprints.utas.edu.au/12273/3/sumner.pdf). 

This will accompany the [trip package](https://github.com/Trackage/trip). 

See "chapter2.pdf". 



## Build

Working on Linux, couldn't get it on Windows. 


```{r eval=FALSE}
knitr::knit("chapter2.Rnw")
tinytex::latexmk("chapter2.tex")
```


## Note

* some hardcoded figures "figures/gunnArchival.png" and the KDE ones were copied from
artefacts
* no citations work, I can't find my bib file yet and `\citep` has been redefined in newcom.tex
